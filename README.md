# README Generator

## Description

READMEs can be a bit tedious to write up repeatedly, so the README Generator is a good tool to relieve some stress. 
Whenever you may be short on time or just burnt out, this tool will whip up a quick .md file for you in minutes. 
During the development of this project, I became much more familiar with doing things within the command line instead of writing code and expecting to see it within the browser.
